Yes: 22.Yes.
No: energy crises causes war to break out, game over in 2010s.





					
15)Coal resources ran out and the world was left in a polluted state, GAME OVER in the 1870s


				
14)Go to question 8



			
6)Metal resources have been depleted.
Go to question 4



4)cut down forests to meet up demands of wood for tools and machinery?
Yes: resources:+2, money:+2, pollution:+3, happiness: -2	:cutting down forests gives tons of wood supply but causes soil erosion, more generation of co2 due to less trees.
No:	 resources:-2, money:-2, pollution:-3, happiness: +1	:lack of resources causes major decline in supply of wood along with production and wealth but the environment remains safe and healthy due to trees.
